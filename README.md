# UC Berkeley Professional Certificate on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

## Overview

This repository serves two primary purposes:

1. **Portfolio Creation**:
   I am using this repository as a public-facing portfolio to showcase my work throughout the program. It is designed to demonstrate my skills to current or prospective employers. Over time, I will add more projects and deliverables, growing it into a comprehensive representation of my expertise.

2. **Data-Driven Analysis**:
   The repository begins with an applied project that explores a business idea proposed by Amazon. Specifically, Amazon is considering a service to help local businesses increase customer traffic by sending drivers targeted coupons for food and drink establishments along their driving routes.
   My task is to use *mMachine Learning (ML)** techniques to determine the feasibility of this idea based on survey data. This analysis will help answer critical questions about the potential success of the service.

## [Project 1: Amazon's Coupon Strategy: A Machine Learning Approach](Practical%20Application%201/Practical%20Application%201.ipynb)

### Business Case

Amazon's idea is to leverage real-time driver route information to send targeted coupons for local businesses. The goal is to assess whether this service would effectively:
- **Drive customer traffic** to local businesses.
- Provide measurable **benefits for Amazon**, such as increased customer engagement and advertising revenue.
- Create **value for local businesses**, resulting in stronger partnerships.

### Key Questions I Aim to Address:
1. Will drivers use the coupons right away, use them later on, or never use them?
2. Is there a difference between coffeehouse coupons and restaurant coupons?
3. What factors influence coupon acceptance, such as time of day, destination, or demographics?
4. Will this strategy work?


## [Project 2: What drives the price of a car?: A CRISP-DM Approach](Practical%20Application%201/Practical%20Application%202.ipynb)

### Business Case

A used car dealership seeks to understand the key factors that influence the price of a used car. By analyzing a dataset of 426K used cars, we aim to identify trends and patterns that determine a vehicle's value. The dealership can leverage these insights to optimize pricing strategies, manage inventory effectively, and better align offerings with customer preferences.

### Key Questions I Aim to Address:
1. What are the most influential factors affecting the price of a used car?
2. How do vehicle mileage and model year influence pricing trends? 
3. Do certain car brands retain value better, and how does vehicle condition affect pricing? 
4. Are there differences in used car pricing based on geographic location? 
5. Do fuel type (e.g., gasoline, diesel, electric) and transmission type (manual vs. automatic) significantly impact resale value?

## Next Steps

1. **Set Up My Portfolio**:
   - I will ensure this repository is well-organized, clean, and professional since it will be part of my portfolio to showcase my skills to the world.
   - I will regularly update it as I add more projects throughout the program.

2. **Dive Into the Project**:
   - Using machine learning techniques, I will deliver meaningful insights into the viability of this idea.

By combining effective portfolio management with data-driven problem-solving, I aim to build valuable skills and demonstrate my expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
